# Changelog

All notable changes to APEX will be documented in this file.

## [Unreleased]

### Fixed
- **CWE-88 argument injection** — validate git refs in `apex diff --base` to reject flag-like values starting with `-` or containing `..`
- **Path traversal in MCP handlers** — canonicalize `params.target` in all MCP tool endpoints before subprocess dispatch
- **Output path validation** — canonicalize `--output` paths in `audit`, `docs`, and `compliance` subcommands
- **Secret-scan false positives** — suppress high-entropy string matches in instrumentation templates, detector source files, and `const` string declarations
- **Dependency-audit graceful fallback** — return info-level finding instead of error when `cargo-audit`/`pip-audit`/`npm audit` are not installed

## [0.2.0] — 2026-03-16

#### Infrastructure

### Changed
- `apex run` shifted from coverage-chasing to bug-hunting strategy
- Workspace expanded from 14 to 16 crates (added `apex-cpg`, `apex-reach`)
- CPG build integrated into `run_audit` pipeline
- Test file exclusion from branch coverage measurement

### Fixed
- 35 bugs found and fixed across 2 bug-hunting rounds (16 + 19)
- Boundary seed overflow: `val + 1` → `saturating_add(1)` in concolic engine
- `>=`/`<=` operators generated wrong boundary values in concolic seeds
- Concolic errors silently swallowed as `Ok(vec![])` — now propagated as `Err`
- Empty module/func generated invalid Python in concolic test synthesis
- Mutex poison panics across 4 crates → `unwrap_or_else(|e| e.into_inner())`
- Heroku UUID regex matched all UUIDs in secret scanner — added context prefix
- `PATTERN_META[idx]` potential panic → safe `.get(idx)` with bounds check
- SQL injection regexes recompiled per call → `static LazyLock<Regex>`
- Circular `$ref` stack overflow in API diff → visited-set cycle detection
- `branch_key` sentinel collision: `None` vs `Some(255)` → string-based keys
- `build_profiles` double-counted tests → `HashSet` deduplication
- `extract_functions` false positives for Java/JS/Python → tighter patterns
- Generic type params included in function names → truncate at `<`
- Istanbul `i as u8` wraps for >255 arms → overflow guard
- Source map `sourceRoot` double-joined with token paths
- Inline base64 source map newline corruption
- `.mjs` sidecar source map path resolution
- Arrow function `=>` misidentified as comparison operator in JS parser
- Self-loop cycle detection in dependency graph
- Fan-in/fan-out missed zero-degree nodes
- SPDX license expression case normalization (`OR`/`Or`/`or`)
- BOM stripping in license file parsing
- Float count parsing and non-bool condition filtering in Rust indexer
- 41 regexes converted from per-call `Regex::new` to `static LazyLock` across 7 crates
- Dead detectors (`MissingTimeoutDetector`, `SessionSecurityDetector`) wired into pipeline
- Z3 solver timeout added to prevent hangs

### Security
- Hardcoded secret detection skips `#[cfg(test)]` blocks to reduce false positives
- Threat model suppression integrated into `SecurityPatternDetector`
- Trust classification tables for internal/external/admin boundaries
